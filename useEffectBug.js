This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an asynchronous operation inside.  The cleanup function within `useEffect` might not be executed properly if the component unmounts before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. For instance, if a network request is made and the component unmounts before the response is received, the promise might still resolve, and attempting to access or manipulate the component state after unmounting will result in an error.
